This code will display a color around the border on the LED of the raspberry pi.

To get the first line of color across the LED you code:

from sense_hat import SenseHat
import time

s = SenseHat()
s.clear()
# (0,0) (0,1) .... (0,7)

for i in range(8): # i goes from 0 to 7 ... It's always range-1 
 s.set_pixel(i,0,255, 30, 30)
 time.sleep(.25) # the time is in a second
